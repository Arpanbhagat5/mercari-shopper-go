1st implementation:
domain/: "What is the core business?" - Entities, core business rules, domain logic.
usecase/: "What can the application do for the user?" - Application-specific workflows, orchestrating domain logic to fulfill user tasks.

Defined the MercariItem struct in the domain layer.
Created a SearchItemsUseCase interface in the usecase layer, defining the contract for searching items.
Created a dummy implementation of SearchItemsUseCase that returns hardcoded data.
Updated our main.go in the cmd/mercari-cli to use the SearchItemsUseCase and display the results.

version 2
interface_adaptors/: "How does the application interact with the outside world?" - Adapters for UI, APIs, databases, external systems, translating data formats.
