1st implementation:

Defined the MercariItem struct in the domain layer.
Created a SearchItemsUseCase interface in the usecase layer, defining the contract for searching items.
Created a dummy implementation of SearchItemsUseCase that returns hardcoded data.
Updated our main.go in the cmd/mercari-cli to use the SearchItemsUseCase and display the results.
